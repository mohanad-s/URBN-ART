        <h1>URBN Gold - Chrome</h1>
        <h2>The Perfect Spray Paint for Chrome Effects</h2>
        <p>The URBN GOLD CHROME EFFECT colors are high quality low-pressure spray paints. The range consists of 3 vibrant chrome effect colors. The unique NC-Acrylic formula is quick-drying and high-covering. Perfect for decorative use, the deceivingly real chrome effects are achieved by the increased reflection of light off the metallic pigment particles that dry on the surface of the paint lacquer or "open" surface.</p>
        <p>Chrome Effect colors can be applied to many surfaces such as canvas, wood, concrete, metal, glass, and even flexible surfaces for any skill level. We highly recommend testing on a small area before full application.</p>
